### Version 1 has been completed Light mapping is set up, then confirm the probe data Sometimes you may find that it may be weaker or stronger than you thought, using this function, Artists can visually modify it and then go back to the SphericalHarmonicsL2 probe data later. 
### No more baking to get back to the original data. Multiply the weighting values to the probe data with the set weighting values. The next extended version is to take the selected probes in the probe cout list, receive them into the list and add functions that just imitate them in real time.
